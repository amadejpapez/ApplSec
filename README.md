# ApplSec
**Twitter bot written in Python that tweets how many vulnerabilities were patched in the new updates to Apple's operating systems.**

### What does the bot do?
Bot checks Apple security update page if there were any new updates released on the current day. If yes, it will gather new links to the releases and gather information like the title, so it knows which update it is and it will count how many vulnerabilities were fixed in each. It will then combine gathered data and tweet it.
